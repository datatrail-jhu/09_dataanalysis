# Final Project

Throughout this course set, we've had a number of projects. This is the last project of the course set that we call the Final project. All of these will be included as Exercises. This means they will *not* be required to pass the course and receive your certificate; however, completing them will *really* help improve your understanding of the material covered and to ensure that you've begun to master the skills needed to be a data scientist.

In each project, we'll aim to get you started and to ask questions that will help guide you through the project. But, we'll intentionally leave pieces out where you have to figure out what needs to be done.

This project will require you to:

* import data from the American Time Use Survey
* clean and tidy the data
* visualize the data
* carry out an exploratory data analysis
* carry out an inferential analysis

You can access the project by going to the exercise accompanying this lesson.

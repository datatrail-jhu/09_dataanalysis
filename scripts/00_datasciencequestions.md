In this lecture, we will discuss what different types of data science questions are.

Data science is the process of making senses of data. A simple understanding of data science can be broken down into Four steps: the first step is to ask yourself what are the data science questions you define that can be answered with data; The second step is to get and clean your data; The third step is to apply data analysis tools to your cleaned-up data to answer the data science questions you asked in the first step. The final step is to present and communicate your analysis results to the public.

In the above steps of discussing what data science is, the very first and important step is to understand what types of data science questions are. There are 6 types of data science questions in approximate from the least to most complex, in terms of knowledge, costs, and time. In summary, they are Descriptive, Exploratory, Inferential, Predictive, Causal, and Mechanistic.

Now we are going to give a short description of what the goal is for each type of the data science question. The goal of descriptive data science questions is to describe large volumes data, targeting a whole population.

The goal of exploratory data science questions is to find unknown relationships by taking a random sample with many variables measured.

The goal of inferential data science questions is to use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population.

The goal of predictive data science question is to use data from some objects to predict values of other objects. We usually perform predictive analysis by spliting the same population into a training and test data set.

The goal of causal data science question is to find out what happens to one variable when you change another. The causal questions are usally applied to data from a randomized study.

The goal of mechanistic data science question is to learn data about all components of the system by understanding the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects. The mechanistic questions are the hardest to infer compared to the other 5 types of questions.

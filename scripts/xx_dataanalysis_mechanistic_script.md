Mechanistic analyses are not nearly as commonly used as the previous analyses - the goal of mechanistic analysis is to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables. These analyses are exceedingly hard to use to infer much, except in simple situations or in those that are nicely modeled by deterministic equations. Given this description, it might be clear to see how mechanistic analyses are most commonly applied to physical or engineering sciences; biological sciences, for example, are far too noisy of data sets to use mechanistic analysis. Often, when these analyses are applied, the only noise in the data is measurement error, which can be accounted for. You can generally find examples of mechanistic analysis in material science experiments. Here, we have a study on biocomposites (essentially, making biodegradable plastics) that was examining how biocarbon particle size, functional polymer type and concentration affected mechanical properties of the resulting "plastic." They are able to do mechanistic analyses through a careful balance of controlling and manipulating variables with very accurate measures of both those variables and the desired outcome.

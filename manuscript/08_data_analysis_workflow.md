### DataCamp:  Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse

{case-sensitive: false}
? To get more practice working through all the steps in a data analysis, go to the course [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse) on DataCamp. Login and complete the entire course. 

Note that some topics cover a bit more material than we've covered in this course. You may have to Google and look on StackOverflow to work through a few parts of the data analysis. This is likely to be the case when you're analyzing data on your own as well, so it's good practice. 

Once you've completed the course, type "completed" in the box below.

*Note*: This requires a DataCamp login, which costs money. As an exercise, this is not required to pass the course but it *will* help you get a better grasp on the concepts covered in these lessons.

*Reminder*: Videos in DataCamp are essential to understanding the material. It's best not to skip over these videos!

### 2. Exploratory analysis 

The goal of exploratory analysis is to examine or **explore** the data and find **relationships** that weren't previously known. Exploratory analyses explore how different measures might be related to each other but do not confirm that relationship as causitive. You've probably heard the phrase "Correlation does not imply causation" and exploratory analyses lie at the root of this saying. Just because you observe a relationship between two variables during exploratory analysis, it does not mean that one necessarily causes the other. 

Because of this, exploratory analyses, while useful for discovering new connections, should not be the final say in answering a question! It can allow you to formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collection, but exploratory analysis alone should never be used as the final say on why or how data might be related to each other.

Going back to the census example from above, rather than just summarizing the data points within a single variable, we can look at how two or more variables might be related to each other. In the plot below, we can see the percent of the workforce that is made up of women in various sectors and how that has changed between 2000 and 2016. Exploring this data, we can see quite a few relationships. Looking just at the top row of the data, we can see that women make up a vast majority of nurses and that it has slightly decreased in 16 years. While these are interesting relationships to note, the causes of these relationships is not apparent from this analysis. All exploratory analysis can tell us is that a relationship exists, not the cause.

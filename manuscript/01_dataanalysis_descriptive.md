### 1. Descriptive analysis 

The goal of descriptive analysis is to **describe** or **summarize** a set of data. Whenever you get a new dataset to examine, this is usually the first kind of analysis you will perform. Descriptive analysis will generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. You may be familiar with common descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency (eg: mean, median, mode) or measures of variability (eg: range, standard deviations or variance). 

This type of analysis is aimed at summarizing your sample -- not for generalizing the results of the analysis to a larger population or trying to make conclusions. Description of data is separated from making interpretations; generalizations and interpretations require additional statistical steps. 

Some examples of purely descriptive analysis can be seen in censuses. Here, the government collects a series of measurements on all of the country's citizens, which can then be summarized. Here, you are being shown the age distribution in the US, stratified by sex. The goal of this is just to describe the distribution. There is no inferences about what this means or predictions on how the data might trend in the future. It is just to show you a summary of the data collected.

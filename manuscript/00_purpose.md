# The purpose of data science

Data science is the process of making senses of data. A simple understanding of data science can be broken down into Four steps: the first step is to ask yourself what are the data science questions you define that can be answered with data; The second step is to get and clean your data; The third step is to apply data analysis tools to your cleaned-up data to answer the data science questions you asked in the first step. The final step is to present and communicate your analysis results to the public. We have already discussed what the second step (getting and cleaning data). In this course, we will discuss the first (asking questions) and the third steps (data analysis) and in a future course, we will go over how to communicate your analysis.

First things first, what is a data science question? This may be a strong claim, but we can phrase most real world questions with data science questions. 




the very first and important step is to understand what types of data science questions are. 





### What are types of data science questions?
Below are the four types of data science questions that we will cover in this course. In summary,

* Descriptive: The goal of descriptive data science questions is to describe large volumes data, targeting a whole population.

* Exploratory: The goal of exploratory data science questions is to find unknown relationships by taking a random sample with many variables measured.

* Inferential: The goal of inferential data science questions is to use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population.

* Predictive: The goal of predictive data science question is to use data from some objects to predict values of other objects. We usually perform predictive analysis by spliting the same population into a training and test data set.

In the following lessons, we will learn how to aks a question

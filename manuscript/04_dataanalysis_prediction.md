### 4. Predictive analysis 

The goal of predictive analysis is to use **current** data to make **predictions** about **future** data. Essentially, you are using current and historical data to find patterns and predict the likelihood of future outcomes. 

Like in inferential analysis, your accuracy in predictions is dependent on measuring the right variables. If you aren't measuring the right variables to predict an outcome, your predictions aren't going to be accurate. Additionally, there are many ways to build up prediction models with some being better or worse for specific cases, but in general, having more data and a simple model generally performs well at predicting future outcomes. 

All this being said, much like in exploratory analysis, just because one variable may predict another, it does not mean that one causes the other; you are just capitalizing on this observed relationship to predict the second variable. 
 
A common saying is that prediction is hard, especially about the future. There aren't easy ways to gauge how well you are going to predict an event until that event has come to pass; so evaluating different approaches or models is a challenge. 

We spend a lot of time trying to predict things - the upcoming weather, the outcomes of sports events, and in the example we'll explore here, the outcomes of elections. We've previously mentioned Nate Silver at [FiveThirtyEight](fivethirtyeight.com), where they try and predict the outcomes of U.S. elections (and sports matches, too!). Using historical polling data and trends and current polling, FiveThirtyEight builds models to predict the outcomes and the next US Presidential vote - and has been fairly accurate at doing so! FiveThirtyEights models accurately predicted the 2008 and 2012 elections and was widely considered an outlier in the 2016 US elections, as it was one of the few models to suggest Donald Trump at having a chance of winning.

Beyond looking at a single numeric variable, what if you had two groups and wanted to know if the proportions of a second variable within the groups differed? To test to see if the proportions within one group differs from the proportions in the second group, we'll use the function prop dot test. For this example, we'll look to the quine dataset from the MASS package. This dataset includes a sample of 146 students in rural New South Wales. In this case, our population is students in Rural New South Wales. Our sample is the 146 students for whom we have data. 

In this example, we're going to check to see if the proportion of aboriginal males in the dataset is different from the proportion of aboriginal females. The variable Eth contains an "A" if the individual is aboriginal, "N" otherwise. Sex is coded such that "M" is male and "F" is female. From the raw values, we see there are 38 aboriginal females and 31 males. It's hard to tell from this output whether or not those proportions truly differ from one another. Is 38 out of 80 different than 31 out of 66? Thus, we'll use a statistical test to draw an inference from this sample.

As mentioned earlier, prop dot test allows you to test whether or not the proportions between groups are the same. Here, again, we'll looked to the confidence interval to interpret our results. If the proportion of aboriginals in each group is equal, we'd expect the difference between them to be zero. Thus, if zero is contained within the 95 percent confidence interval, there is no statistical difference between the proportions of aboriginals in the male and female groups. This is the case we see here in these data, as zero is between -0.16 and 0.17.
